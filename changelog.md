## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2020-12-03

- Viewing, searching, creating, updating, and deleting events from the database through api. Updates against a non-existent item in the database will result in update success message, although the item won't be created. This is the same with deletions.

- Front end and back end intergration with events table in database. [AJAX CRUD Tutorial Using JavaScript, JSON and PHP â€“ Step by Step Guide! ](https://codeofaninja.com/2015/06/php-crud-with-ajax-and-oop.html).
- View, create, selecting and updating specific events via user interface. The selecting a specific event api will need to be reworked to include more information about the event (such as the hosting executive, budget, etc.).

### Added
- This changelog to keep track of changes as the project developes. 
- A readme describing how to run a released version of the project. 
- A basic SQL dump file containing the database for the backend. The schema differes from the relational model created in that:
  * The `event` table does not have a foreign key to the `fundraiser` table.
  * `performance` table links to `event` via event_name only.
  * `budget` has many sections which are added as int fields. The sum of all fields should equal the amount of the corresponding row in `financial_transaction` when querying with transaction_no.
- Basic front-end elements.
- A .gitignore for Database.
