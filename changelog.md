- This changelog to keep track of changes as the project developes. 
- A readme describing how to run a released version of the project. 
- A basic SQL dump file containing the database for the backend. The schema differes from the relational model created in that:
  * The `event` table does not have a foreign key to the `fundraiser` table.
  * `performance` table links to `event` via event_name only.
  * `budget` has many sections which are added as int fields. The sum of all fields should equal the amount of the corresponding row in `financial_transaction` when querying with transaction_no.
- Basic front-end elements.
- A .gitignore for Database.
